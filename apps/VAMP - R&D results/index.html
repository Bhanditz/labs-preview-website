<p><strong>VAMP Metadata validation</strong> - Semantic validation of MPEG-7 documents.</p><p>VAMP is a validation service for MPEG-7 documents. VAMP checks if a given MPEG-7 document conforms to a selected MPEG-7 profile. It supports the Audiovisual Description Profile (AVDP)proposed by the European Broadcasting Union and currently under standardisation.</p><p>VAMP semantically validates the conformance of MPEG-7 descriptions to a given profile. The semantic constraints of the given profile are formalised by an ontology and by logical rules. As a first step, the MPEG-7 input document is checked to see if it is syntactically valid against the MPEG-7 Profile Schema. Then the MPEG-7 input document is semantically validated.</p><p>The semantic constraints from a given MPEG-7 profile cannot be expressed by using XML schema alone. Semantic web technologies are also used for this purpose. XML schema validation is therefore only one part of the VAMP validation service.</p><p>A Java client application is available for validating local documents and batch processing.</p><p>See the VAMP <a href='http://vamp.joanneum.at/'>prototype:</a></p>
