To perform general API calls, like search, object or provider/collection, which do not involve user-specific information, the most basic authentication scheme is used. For accessing user-specific data stored on MyEuropeana accounts using MyData calls, a caller application is to be identified by the user credentials. Finally, for applications wishing to get 3rd party access on behalf of a registered user, OAuth2 authentication scheme is supported. This is the simplest form of authentication which does not involve accessing user-specific information. To perform a call using this authentication every API call must be provided a special authentication parameter wskey. This value of this parameter should be the public key that you got during the API user registration process. We use these keys to anonymously gather interesting statistics about API usage. If you forget your API key or need to generate a new one, login to My Europeana. This form of authentication is used when an application wishes to access MyEuropeana data of a specific user and the public and the private keys of this user are known available in advance. In this case login is done by calling a POST method with the following two parameters that contain authentication credentials: When a login is successful a status 200 is returned, otherwise a redirect to the login page is triggered.  For applications that wish to access MyEuropeana data of a specific end-user on his behalf, we use the standard OAuth2 authentication scheme. This scheme works by redirecting the application to a dedicated login page provided by the server and issuing to the application an authenticating token with a limited lifetime when the login is succesful. The token can be refreshed later on by the application. To use this kind of authentication the application should first access the URL and further on the URL to refresh the token. There are many open source libraries available for various languages to help you implement this authentication scheme in your project. For more information, consult the OAuth2 reference page.","tags":[],"imageurl":[""],"excerpt":"Uset authentication in Europeana REST API"},{"title":"Get your API key","url":"/api/registration/","date":null,"categories":[],"body":"Sign up for your free API key and get developing!

The API uses the standard web technology of REST calls over HTTP. Responses are returned in the popular JSON format. To get straight to the point of the API, you can go directly to the Getting Started page which tells you only what you have to know to start using the API. To start using the API you should register at the registration page. Upon registration you will get your individual private authentication key. This key should be used when calling API methods as a special wskey authentication parameter. The current version of the Europeana API (API2) is fully backward compatible with the previous version (API1). However, we encourage developers to switch to the new naming of the fields that were used in API1. For more information on the mapping between the new and the old fields, please see API1-API2 Fields Mapping. There is a method for developers to see how Europeana API works and test it for their needs without getting registered - the API console. This is an interactive tool that allows filling method parameters in an online form and see both the expected results and the exact format of the call that should be used by an application to get these results. The API console has been built by us for developers’ convenience. You are encouraged to use it and provide us feedback about its usability for the developer community.

Test on API Console Test on API Console Both parameters accept numeric values. The default offset value is 0, starting from the first item in the list. 1 offsets the list by one, so the first item to return is the second and so on.

The following example searches for objects whose location is in Paris or in London: Test on API Console The boolean NOT operator cannot be used alone but only in conjunction with another boolean operator. For example, looking for objects which contain the term Lisa but do not contain the term Mona is done by the following: Test on API Console To execute range queries, the range operator should be used. This example will search for objects whose field values fall between a and z: Test on API Console As well as for textual fields it can also be used for numeric values, date ranges, or geographical areas, as shown below. Looking for objects dated by a year between 1525 and 1527: Test on API Console To search for objects by their geographic location you should specify the bounding box of the area. You need to use the range operator and the pl_wgs84_pos_lat (latitude position) and pl_wgs84_pos_long (longitude position) field. The following example will bring all the objects found between the latitude of 45° and 47° and between the longitude of 7° and 8°: Test on API Console One can also search objects by date. Currently, full-fledge date search is supported only for the fields storing the creation (timestamp_created) and update (timestamp_update) dates of the objects which are available in two formats: the UNIX epoch timestamp and the ISO 8601 formatted date. To search for objects created or updated on a given date, use the following query: Test on API Console Test on API Console Test on API Console Test on API Console With date mathematics you can formulate questions, such as “in the last two months” of “in the previous week”. The basic operations and their symbols are addition (+), substraction (-) and rounding (/). Some examples: The date units are: YEAR, YEARS, MONTH, MONTHS, DAY, DAYS, DATE, HOUR, HOURS, MINUTE, MINUTES, SECOND, SECONDS, MILLI, MILLIS, MILLISECOND, MILLISECONDS (the plural, singular, and abbreviated forms refer to the same unit). Let’s see how to apply it in Europeana’s context. From xxx up until now Test on API Console From xxx up until tomorrow Test on API Console Note: be careful, that the plus sign’s proper URL encoded value is %2B, and sometimes space character is encoded as ‘+’ sing, and it easy to mix up the encoded space with the unencoded plus. From xxx up until yesterday Test on API Console Changes in the last two months Test on API Console You can find more about data mathematics at Solr’s API documentation So far we dealt with examples where there was only one query term. Sometimes it is useful to split a query into a variable and a constant part. For instance, for an application that accesses only objects located in London, it is possible to have the constant part of the query pre-selecting London-based objects and the variable part selecting objects within this pre-selection. This can be done using the refinement parameter qf which is appended to the query parameter. This example looks for objects which contain the term Westminster and their location is in London: Test on API Console Refinement parameters can be concatenated. Each such parameter and the mandatory query parameter contributes a breadcrumb object if breadcrumbs are specified in the search profile. Querying by facets is also done using the refinement parameter qf. The following example looks for objects containing the term Paris among images: Test on API Console Here are more examples of faceted search.

Name of a client side (JavaScript) callback function. If you set a funtion the JSON response will be wrapped by this function call, so it is not JSON, but JSONP (JSON with Paggings). JSONP provides a method to request data from a server in a different domain, something prohibited by typical web browsers because of the same origin policy. “Under the same origin policy, a web page served from server1.example.com cannot normally connect to or communicate with a server other than server1.example.com. An exception is the HTML script element. Exploiting the open policy for script elements, some pages use them to retrieve JavaScript code that operates on dynamically generated JSON-formatted data from other origins. This usage pattern is known as JSONP. Requests for JSONP retrieve not JSON, but arbitrary JavaScript code. They are evaluated by the JavaScript interpreter, not parsed by a JSON parser.” (Wikipedia: JSONP) A callback can be added to any JSON-based call by appending &callback=callbackname to the call, where the callbackname should be an existing JavaScript function existing on the client side. The API returns JSONP response, like this one: returns JavaScript processEuropeanaSearch({   \"apikey\":\"xxxxx\",   \"action\":\"record.json\",   \"success\":true,   \"statsDuration\":22,   \"requestNumber\":8,   \"object\":{     \"type\":\"TEXT\",     \"title\":[\"Bibliotheca Indica\"],     \"about\":\"[record ID]\",     ....   } })  The JSON response is wrapped into your function, and the function use JSON as input parameter, and it immediatelly runs when it returns. In your client you have to define the callback function before you call the API. A client side example: HTML <script> function processEuropeanaSearch(json){   alert(json.object.title.join(', ')); } </script> <script src=\"http://europeana.eu/api/v2/record/0000/1111.json?wskey=xxxx&callback=processEuropeanaSearch\"></script>  Of course in this example we didn’t do any rocket science with the returned Europeana record, it is your turn to do some fascinating thing.","tags":[],"imageurl":[""],"excerpt":"Everything you need to know to start using Europeana API right away."},{"title":"API Change Log","url":"/api/changelog/","date":null,"categories":[],"body":"This document describes the changes of Europeana API.

More on Solr date math syntax: (http://lucene.apache.org/solr/4_6_0/solr-core/org/apache/solr/util/DateMathParser.html) So far the user could get the default facets Europeana set. From now on the API users can select which facets they would like to retrieve. We have introduced a new parameter: facet. When you request facet you have to set the profile either as facets or as portal (which covers facets as well). The value of the parameter could be “DEFAULT” (which is a shortcut of the Europeana facet set we make use on the portal, which contains UGC, LANGUAGE, TYPE, YEAR, PROVIDER, DATA_PROVIDER, COUNTRY and RIGHTS), or any field name which is indexed and stored in Apache Solr. We maintain a table in API documentation about the existing fields: http://europeana.eu/portal/api-fields.html. In the field type column “text” means indexed as as a row of distinct terms, while “string” means indexed as phrase, so the whole content is taken as one individual unit. Users can set one or more facets in one query. Requesting a single facet: Requesting multiple facets can be done with three different syntaxes. You can add multiple facet parameters, or one facet parameter with multiple values separated by commas or spaces: multiple facet parameters multiple facets separated by commas multiple facets separated by spaces Requesting the default facets: Combining default facets with custom facets: Offset and limit of facets The API user can set how many facet values she would like to retrieve, and which should be the first one. With this parameters, she can page over all facet values without requesting too much at a time. The limit and offset parameter syntax is a little bit tricky, but if you are familiar with Apache Solr syntax, it won’t be strange, because it is the same. Both parameters accept numeric values. The default offset value is 0, it means no offset, the first item to return is the first item in the list. 1 offset the list by one, so the first item to return is the second and so on. In limit 0 means not to return anything. The special DEFAULT shortcut works here as well, and it limit the facets which are part of the above mentioned set. So &f.DEFAULT.facet.limit=20 works for RIGHTS, and PROVIDER, but doesn’t work for non default facets such as proxy_dc_contributor. The new reusability parameter can have two possible values: Open and Limited. It is an additional filter, which selects those items, which can be reusable free, or in a limited way. They are shorthands for a couple of right values: Free: Limited: It has double effects 1) it filter the search result with the appropriate right values, 2) if facets are requested, it provides a new facet, called REUSABILITY. Example:  http://localhost:8080/api/v2/search.json?wskey=api2demo&query=*:*&reusability=free&qf=TYPE:VIDEO&profile=portal  returns JavaScript {   \"apikey\": \"xxxxxxxxxx\",     \"action\": \"search.json\",     ...   \"items\": [ … ],     ...   \"facets\": [     ...     {         \"name\": \"REUSABILITY\",       \"fields\": [         {\"label\": \"Limited\", \"count\": 9795},         {\"label\": \"Free\", \"count\": 3659}       ]     }   ] }  New allowable value for the profile parameter: params. When client adds params to the profile parameter, the header of the response will contain a params key, which lists the requested and default parameters of the API call. The client can use profile profile parameter in search and object calls. The parameter accepts both single and multiple values separated by comma or space (such as &profile=standard or &profile=standard,params or &profile=standard%20params). Example:  http://europeana.eu/api/v2/search.json?wskey=xxxxxxxx&amp;query=mona+lisa&amp;profile=standard%20params  returns JavaScript {   \"apikey\": \"xxxxxxxxx\",   \"action\": \"search.json\",   \"success\": true,   \"requestNumber\": 6,   \"params\": {     \"query\": \"mona lisa\",     \"profile\": \"standard params\",     \"start\": 1,     \"rows\": 12   },   \"itemsCount\": 12,   \"totalResults\": 195,   \"items\": [...] } ","tags":[],"imageurl":[""],"excerpt":""},{"title":null,"url":"/api/","date":null,"categories":[],"body":"We currently offer two APIs for use.

A detailed description of EDM is beyond the scope of this documentation: the reader is referred to the extensive documentation on Europeana website. However, a basic understanding of the data organization is necessary for implementing the API. The objective of this section is to provide this basic understanding. The Europeana API provides access to the Europeana data, which is modeled using EDM. While EDM is an open flexible data model featuring various kind of resources and relations between them, the Europeana API (and the Europeana Portal) supports the retrieval of a segment of EDM for practical purposes (a subgraph, to use strict terminology). These ‘atomic’ EDM segments usually contain one Cultural Heritage Object (CHO), the aggregation information which connects the metadata and the digital representations together and a number of contextual resources such as the agents, places, concepts and time pertaining to the CHO. The further API documentation, in particular the /record call refers to this subgraph as object.  Digital records delivered to Europeana are assigned a unique identifier, Europeana ID, that serves to further identify the records when using the API. Usually, this identifier is based on the original metadata that are provided for the record and internal Europeana identifiers of the provider and the dataset containing the record. For example, a Europeana ID of an object can look as follows: where 091 is the identifier of the provider, 02 is the id of the dataset and GNM_1234 is derived from the unique identifier of the record in the context of the provider. Europeana data is organized in records which correspond to cultural heritage objects. Each object is described by a number of fields in the record which contain information such as the title of the object, its description, the date, persons and concepts related to it. Europeana aggregates its data from cultural institutions that can use diverse, fine-grained systems and methodologies. As a result, a link between for example an object and a person may be stored in different specialized fields. To provide simpler views on this data, Europeana has introduced several general Aggregated Fields: title, who, what, when, and where. In these fields we gather together information from different record fields in order to make the discovery of objects easier. Title, for example, aggregates data from the dc:title and dcterms:alternative fields which are part of Dublin Core, a popular general standard for describing different types of resources. The number of records that Europeana contains is very big and growing. Therefore we need efficient ways to allow our users to discover what they need easily. One such technique is a faceted indexing system that classifies each record along multiple dimensions. The facets, seen on the left side of the Europeana portal, can be useful for filtering search results and can also be used by API users. Currently we support the following facets:","tags":[],"imageurl":[""],"excerpt":"How Europeana data hierarchy is organized"},{"title":"API Data Fields","url":"/api/data-fields/","date":null,"categories":[],"body":"Each Europeana field has different names in different contexts.

The metadata for all the objects in the Europeana portal is open, in that it is all licensed under the CC0 Public Domain Dedication under the terms of the Data Exchange Agreement (DEA), and can be freely downloaded via the API. In October 2012, a large subset of this data was transformed into linked data and made available from data.europeana.eu. The data is represented in the Europeana Data Model (EDM). For more information, see our datasets page. data.europeana.eu started as an experimental pilot  in February 2012 with a small number of data providers who committed at an early stage to Europeana's initiative of promoting more open data. The current version of the pilot contains metadata on 20 million texts, images, videos and sounds gathered by Europeana.

It assumes that the reader has extensive knowledge of Linked Data technology. The project has also been described in the technical paper presented at the Dublin Core 2011 conference. Disclaimer: Many aspects documented in this page are experimental and thus remain open for discussion and change.  The Europeana Data Model was designed to replace the Europeana Semantic Elements (ESE). EDM is now gradually making Europeana fit within a networked data environment. It is a much more flexible and precise model than ESE, and offers the opportunity to attach every statement to the specific resource it applies to, and to reflect some basic form of data provenance. The main EDM requirements include: distinguishing between a 'provided item' (painting, book) and its digital representations distinguishing between an item and the metadata record describing it allowing the ingestion of multiple records for the same item, which may contain contradictory statements about it As a consequence of EDM having to meet these requirements, EDM data has a level of complexity above that which Europeana currently maintains. This level of complexity is comparable to what can be found in the data of many Europeana providers, and thus, we argue, it enables better exploitation of that data. Note also that, as much as possible, EDM re-uses elements coming from already-established vocabularies, such as Dublin Core, OAI-ORE, SKOS and CIDOC-CRM, thus lowering the cost of its creation and, hopefully, its adoption.</p> For more information on EDM, we refer to the EDM Definitions and EDM Primer on Europeana's technical documents page. The EDM OWL ontology is accessible through content negotiation but it is also directly available. Please be aware that both data.europeana.eu and those documents are under constant revision. There could therefore be some (minor) discrepancies between them! The data available in the pilot results from a conversion of legacy ESE data into EDM. This entails creating resources for the main EDM classes, and distributing ESE metadata fields over these various resources, as presented in this mapping. The resulting data does not realise the full potential offered by EDM but it allows us to make some distinctions, which we believe are useful for data consumers. Additionally, data.europeana.eu includes semantic connections to external (linked data) sources. We serve links to other linked data services already maintained by Europeana providers - currently only the Swedish cultural heritage aggregator (SOCH). The vast majority of external links come from semantic enrichment realised at the Europeana Office, connecting Europeana items to places (as provided by GeoNames), concepts (from the GEMET thesaurus), persons (from DBpedia) and time periods (from an adhoc time period vocabulary).  The core EDM classes, together with the properties we expect to be applied to their instances, are presented in these templates. Of course it is unrealistic that all of those properties would be available for any single object exposed in Europeana. This is especially true for items that are described using the simple legacy ESE format. In particular, Europeana does not currently harvest any description for contextual entities, such as concepts, agents and places. Still, the ESE data harvested from Europeana providers, as well as the enrichment work by Europeana, allows us to create and describe a network of EDM resources for every Europeana object, as shown in this big picture example. The following explains in more detail the data that can be found for every class of resource served by data.europeana.eu: Item (Provided Cultural Heritage Object): Item resources represent objects (painting, book, etc.) for which institutions provide digital representations to be accessed through Europeana. Provided Cultural Heritage Object (CHO) URIs (for example,  http://data.europeana.eu/item/92037/25F9104787668C4B5148BE8E5AB8DBEF5BE5FE03, (raw data) are the main entry points in data.europeana.eu. A provided CHO is the hub of the network of relevant resources (cf. below). When applicable, the Europeana URIs for these objects also link, via 'owl:sameAs' statements, to other linked data resources about the same object, for example this item (raw data). In this Linked Data pilot, no descriptive metadata (creator, subject, etc.) is directly attached to item URIs. It is instead attached to the proxies that represent a view of the object, from a specific institution's perspective (either a Europeana provider or Europeana itself). Depending on the feedback received during this pilot, we may change this and duplicate all the descriptive metadata at the level of the item URI. Such an option is costly in terms of data verbosity, but it would enable easier access to metadata for data consumers less concerned about provenance.  Provider's proxy: These resources (for example, [http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/92037/25F9104787668C4B5148BE8E5AB8DBEF5BE5FE03] (http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/92037/25F9104787668C4B5148BE8E5AB8DBEF5BE5FE03); (raw data) are used as subjects of descriptive statements (creator, subject, date of creation, etc.) for the item, which are contributed by a Europeana provider. In the OAI-ORE model, proxies enable the separation of different views for the same resource, in the context of different aggregations. This allows us to distinguish the original metadata for the object from the metadata that is created by Europeana, an important requirement for us. Descriptive properties that apply to these proxies mostly come from Dublin Core : view an example. Proxies are connected to the item they represent a facet of using the 'ore:proxyFor' property. They are attached to the aggregation that contextualises them using 'ore:proxyIn'. Note to the reader: given the lack of support for named graphs (aka 'quadruples') in the RDF standard, ORE introduced proxies in order to support referencing resources in the context of a graph. Eventually, named graphs may be natively supported by RDF, which would lead to obsolescence of the proxy construct.  Provider's aggregation: These resources (e.g., http://data.europeana.eu/aggregation/provider/92037/25F9104787668C4B5148BE8E5AB8DBEF5BE5FE03; (raw data) provide data related to a Europeana provider's gathering of digitised representations and descriptive metadata for an item. As shown in this data, they are related to digital resources about the item, be they files directly representing it ('edm:object' and 'edm:isShownBy') or webpages showing the object in context ('edm:isShownAt'). They may also provide controlled rights information applying to these resources ('edm:rights'). Other statements provided in the same ESE record as the descriptive metadata for the item – but that do not always clearly apply to it – are also attached to aggregations. Finally, provenance data is given in statements using 'edm:provider' (the direct provider to Europeana in the data aggregation chain) or 'edm:dataProvider' (the cultural institution that curates the object). The aggregation is connected to the item resource using the 'edm:aggregatedCHO' property.  Europeana's proxy: The second type of proxies served at data.europeana.eu. are Europeana proxies (e.g., http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/europeana/92037/25F9104787668C4B5148BE8E5AB8DBEF5BE5FE03; (raw data) which provide access to the metadata created by Europeana for a given item, distinct from the metadata provided by the provider. Here one can find 'edm:year' statements, indicating a normalised date associated with the object. We also serve millions of generic 'edm:hasMet' enrichments, created by Europeana from a range of ESE descriptive fields (read documentation). These statements connect a Europeana proxy to places from GeoNames, concepts from the GEMET thesaurus, persons from DBpedia and periods from an adhoc time vocabulary. Finally, a proxy is connected to the item it represents a facet of, using the 'ore:proxyFor' property, as well as to the aggregation</a> that contextualises it, using 'ore:proxyIn'.  Europeana's aggregation: a Europeana aggregation (for example, http://data.europeana.eu/aggregation/europeana/92037/25F9104787668C4B5148BE8E5AB8DBEF5BE5FE03, (raw data) bundles together the result of all data creation and aggregation efforts for a given item. It aggregates the provider's aggregation (using ore:aggregates), which in turn will connect to the provider's proxy. Next to the provider aggregation, one can find the digitised resources Europeana.eu serves for the item, i.e., an object page ('edm:landingPage') and a thumbnail (using a combination of 'edm:hasView' and 'foaf:thumbnail'). The Europeana proxy is also connected to this aggregation, as mentioned above.  Resource map: OAI-ORE Resource maps are constructs for indicating meta-level statements about the creation and publication of ORE data (ORE aggregations and their aggregated resources). We are exploring their use as a contextualisation mechanism for the Europeana aggregation. Maps (for example, http://data.europeana.eu/rm/europeana/92037/25F9104787668C4B5148BE8E5AB8DBEF5BE5FE03; (raw data) are connected to an item they are about using 'foaf:primaryTopic', and to its corresponding Europeana aggregation using 'ore:describes'. They sum up the provenance of data using 'dc:creator' and 'dc:contributor' statements. Crucially, they also indicate, in a machine-readable way, that the (RDF) data served at data.europeana.eu is provided under the CC0 Public Domain Dedication.

Linked Data offers many opportunities to the cultural sector, as suggested in the recent reports from the W3C Library Linked Data incubator group and our own animation. Releasing Europeana metadata as Linked Open Data is an important step for Europeana, its partners and third parties. Linked Open Data has a key role in the Europeana Strategic Plan 2011-2015  and supports the idea that Europeana ‘distributes’ content and ‘engages’ its users: Distribute: the pilot will allow Europeana to distribute the cultural heritage content, in order to ‘Make their heritage available to users wherever they are, whenever they want it’. Engage: it will also enhance the engagement of the different communities represented by Europeana’s content by allowing re-use and connectivity. First, Linked Data is a publishing technique that enables related data to be connected and makes it easily accessible using common Web technologies. See this White Paper for further discussion on the scientific interest of Linked Data for the Europeana community. Second, Linked Open Data realises this in an open manner, where everyone can access, re-use, enrich and share the data published. See this business document for further explanation on why Europeana and its partners should open the metadata they gather from all around Europe, and the Support for open data section of our site for general information on Europeana’s efforts. You may also be interested in this paper at Museum & the Web that gives interesting context and pointers to current Linked Open Data developments. The data served by data.europeana.eu is generated from the metadata Europeana has harvested using the Europeana Semantic Elements (ESE)(http://pro.europeana.eu/technical-requirements). To make this data amenable to Linked Data publishing, we have converted it to the Resource Description Framework (RDF) format, and structured it using the Europeana Data Model. We give more detail on the EDM data we publish on the Data Structure page. In addition to the original data harvested by Europeana from its data providers, the data served at data.europeana.eu includes: links to other Linked Open Data services which hold information about objects that are also served by data.europeana.eu: for the moment this only concerns the Swedish cultural heritage aggregator (SOCH) semantic enrichment done at the Europeana Office, connecting Europeana objects to structured representations of places (using GeoNames, concepts (using the GEMET thesaurus), people (using DBpedia) and time periods(from an adhoc time period vocabulary). As this project is about engaging users from different communities, we've made sure that data from the pilot can be accessed, re-used, enriched and shared by everyone. data.europeana.eu is serving metadata following the terms of the Creative Commons CC0 public domain dedication. File dumps of the RDF data are available on the data downloads</a> page. You can also fetch a subset of this data over the HTTP protocol, using established Linked Data recipes, most notably the use of HTTP URIs as identifiers and entry points into data. Here are some examples of these data.europeana.eu resources: http://data.europeana.eu/item/92037/25F9104787668C4B5148BE8E5AB8DBEF5BE5FE03 refers to a real-world object for which digital resources are available through Europeana (access data). http://data.europeana.eu/aggregation/provider/92037/25F9104787668C4B5148BE8E5AB8DBEF5BE5FE03 links to the digital resources submitted on that object by its provider, and gives meta-information on the digital resource aggregation process, e.g., the name of the data provider (raw data). http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/92037/25F9104787668C4B5148BE8E5AB8DBEF5BE5FE03 gives all the data that applies to the real-world object, from the perspective of the Europeana provider (raw data). http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/europeana/92037/25F9104787668C4B5148BE8E5AB8DBEF5BE5FE03 gives all the data that applies to the real-world object, from the perspective of Europeana.

We also provide the datasets as file dumps of the RDF data at data downloads page. If you are a Europeana data provider, you don't need to submit your data again to Europeana. Once the Data Exchange Agreement (DEA) has been signed, we just fetch the metadata Europeana has already gathered. For technical reasons, we cannot continuously update the dataset we serve, but we plan to release batch updates, making all new datasets available at once.

JSON-LD is stands for JSON for Linking Data, and is lightweight Linked Data format. The basic structure of the JSON-LD response is similar to a normal single Record JSON request: ``` JavaScript { } ``` The big differences between normal JSON and JSON-LD are 1) JSON-LD makes use of Internationalized Resource Identifiers, IRIs as property names. This ensures that each statement of a record matches a standard vocabulary. In Europeana’s implementation the properties are qualified names (in the format of “namespace_prefix:property_name” such as “dc:creator”) for the sake of brevity. In the normal JSON response we use non-standard camel case (“dcCreator”) property names. In the data fields page you can find the connections between our camelCase property names and the JSON-LD and RDF qualified names. 2) JSON-LD has a @context part, which links object properties in a JSON document to concepts in an ontology. In our JSON-LD  this lists the used namespaces and their prefixes. 3) JSON-LD makes a distinction between the resource type values (), and string literals A resource value:  JavaScript \"edm:landingPage\": {   \"@id\": \"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/09102/_CM_0839888.html\" },   A normal string literal:  JavaScript \"dc:creator\": \"Europeana\", ","tags":[],"imageurl":[""],"excerpt":"Retrieving a single record from the dataset in JSON-LD format"},{"title":"Search Widget","url":"/api/search-widget/","date":null,"categories":[],"body":"You can add a Europeana search box to your blog or website.

For more details see the [Annotorious entry] (http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/Annotorious-FLOSS/) The EuropeanaConnect Annotation Suite - A tool that allows end-users to annotate digital images, maps, audio and video files. The EuropeanaConnect Annotation Suite gives users the ability to annotate digital images and maps, as well as audio and video objects. Parts of the annotation suite have been integrated into Europeana, but some challenges will need to be overcome before it can be fully implemented: 1. It only makes sense to annotate full-scale images (maps), and full-length audio tracks or videos. Currently, Europeana does not have full access to most objects. 2. The audio and the video components use Flash, but Europeana currently does not support Flash. The image annotation interface allows the user to annotate full-scale images; it is based on the Google Web Toolkit. The map annotation interface is a special variant of the image annotation one. It adds a number of several Geographic Information System (GIS) related features and uses tiled full-scale images, which allows for a user experience similar to that of services like Google Maps. The audio and video components of the EuropeanaConnect Annotation Suite use a modified Flash player. The audio annotation tool only allows for the annotation of time segments of an audio track or its entirety, while the video annotation tool adds features that are similar to those of the image annotation tool.

The Linked Logainm dataset and Location LODer website were launched on 10 September 2013 by Jimmy Deenihan, TD, Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht at the National Library of Ireland. Logainm.ie, the bilingual database of Irish place names has recently been enhanced by the Linked Logainm project by incorporating Linked Data. The newly available Linked Logainm dataset provides Irish place name data in structured, computer-readable formats for use by web developers, computer scientists, the heritage community, information professionals and more. The linked dataset is now ready for use by Irish information professionals in the library, museum and archives domains. The project was undertaken collaboratively by the Digital Repository of Ireland (DRI), INSIGHT@NUIGalway (formerly the Digital Enterprise Research Institute), Fiontar at Dublin City University, the National Library of Ireland and the Placenames Branch of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht of the Irish Government. As well as transforming the geographic Logainm dataset to Linked Data, the project team also developed the demonstrator website Location LODer. Location LODer is built on the Linked Logainm dataset and a map interface, allowing users to explore content and digital resources relating to locations across Ireland. Selecting a place name on the map loads the available content, sourced from logainm.ie, DBpedia, the National Library of Ireland’s Longfield Maps collection, the Irish Historic Towns Atlas project and Europeana. Location LODer aims to demonstrate how Linked Data technologies can enhance the catalogues of Irish cultural institutions. Location LODer gathers information using different SPARQL and Linked Open Data endpoints where available - namely Europeana and DBpedia. The Europeana SPARQL endpoint available at http://europeana.ontotext.com/sparql is used to retrieve objects that might relate to Irish place names. When a specific place name is selected in Location LODer, the Europeana SPARQL endpoint is queried for any objects that contain both the selected place name and its county name as a ‘dc:subject’ and a ‘spatial’ property of ‘Ireland’. Results are retrieved in JSON format to be rendered in the appropriate section of the website. A similar approach is applied to the DBpedia endpoint at http://dbpedia.org/sparql/, however for this endpoint we rely on previously determined links that are included in the Logainm dataset. The MARC records for the National Library of Ireland’s Longfield Map Collection were enhanced to include links to the newly created Linked Logainm URIs, and this information is used to retrieve the maps relevant to the place name the user has selected. A short presentation on the process of creating the Linked Logainm dataset and the enhancing of the MARC records was presented at the First Workshop on Linking and Contextualizing Publications and Datasets (presentation is available at http://www.slideshare.net/nunoalexandrelopes/presentation-26782239”).

VAMP semantically validates the conformance of MPEG-7 descriptions to a given profile. The semantic constraints of the given profile are formalised by an ontology and by logical rules. As a first step, the MPEG-7 input document is checked to see if it is syntactically valid against the MPEG-7 Profile Schema. Then the MPEG-7 input document is semantically validated.

Learn about the data, see what others have created, and find out how to build simple but powerful queries to extract bespoke results from a dataset of over 30 million objects - books, photos of art and artefacts, audio clips and more. Last year we consulted with the developer community asking them what things would help them to make best use of the Europeana APIs. This Europeana Labs Beta site is the first major step towards putting in place the things we were told, but also a chance for us to learn more and make improvements before a full launch in late June. We’ve pulled together some great examples of both content and existing applications to give you a real taste for what is possible. This is backed up by a revamp of the API documentation, providing everything you should need to exploit the full potential of the Europeana platform and get creative with the content. But wherever you are, whatever your skills, and no matter what you’re planning, don’t be afraid to ask for help as we’re here to support you. Once you have an idea and you want to start building your application, head to our comprehensive online documentation. It covers both the REST API and Linked Open Data, with extensive examples illustrating methods, syntax, and responses. You can also use the API Console to build and test anything from the simplest search to a complex query using facets such as dates, geotags and permissions. Even if you’re new to Europeana, getting started is simple. 1. Register for an API key 2. Use the API Console to explore the content and customise queries. If you need help, check out the example Datasets and consult our extensive API documentation. 3. Build your application. If you don’t know where to start, find inspiration in the Application Gallery - many applications have public code repositories and there’s also a Java library and Python wrapper available. There are lots of ways you can get help with using the Europeana APIs. Contact us directly via our contact form or at api@europeana.eu. If you want to chat with fellow developers head over to the API Forum on Google Groups and you can also follow @EuropeanaTech on Twitter. The Labs site is currently in beta, with a full launch planned in late June. We’d love to have your feedback on what you think works, and what needs improvement. We’re also happy to hear of any ideas you have. Please take a few minutes to fill out our quick survey and tell us what you think. Image credit: \"La chimie\" by Bernard Picart.

A user can therefore connect different multimedia resources around a topic or an event by creating explicit relationships between them and play them synchronously within the same interface. Each annotation created within the tool contains: * a text description, as in any other annotation tools * a link between two different media , which are related through a time relation. The user can annotate an object using a resource as a whole (e.g. an image) or by using only a part of this resource (e.g. few minutes of a video). Once an object has been completely annotated, the user can play the different media in parallel and start comparison work. The users can play several related annotations, creating their own story by navigating among them. The stories are personal experiences that can be shared among users. This is very interesting and useful for educational purpose and for leisure.</p> MyStoryPlayer is based on a semantic database using a RDF ontology and can be used as a web application.

Pundit not only enables users to annotate Web pages in various ways (comments, citations, boo kmarks…) but also to convert these annotations into semantically structured data that can be later integrated to the “Semantic Web”. The framework to represent the annotations is based on the Open Annotation model. The ability to express semantic relationships between resources relies on the use of ontologies and vocabularies (such as Freebase.com and Dbpedia.org) that can be configured according to the needs of the communities using Pundit. The re-use of resources already available on the web provides solutions to multilinguality or disambiguation related challenges. In Pundit each annotation is described by data structured in RDF which connects the annotated object (a manuscript, a video…) to other objects or entities available as Linked Data. Semantic relationships based on URIs are created between the different entities identified in a given web page. Pundit stores annotations on an RDF based server which exposes APIs to consume annotations along with their structured content. Pundit is also a collaborative platform which allows users to team up during the annotation creation process, to share their results and also re-use annotations created by other users. It therefore participates in the dialogue between scholars and in the creation of new knowledge. For more technical details on Pundit, see http://www.thepund.it/publications/. See the Pundit demo The DM2E (Digitised Manuscripts to Europeana) project further develops Pundit in the context of humanities research based on the Europeana content and metadata.

This is an extract from a blog post previously published by Péter Király, software developer at Europeana. To read the full article visit http://kirunews.blog.hu/2014/02/13/solr_query_facets_in_europeana One of Europeana’s important aims is to make the rights statements of records clear and straightforward. You can imagine, our >2,400 partners have different approaches for licensing their objects, and right now in the database we have 60+ different licence types, in other words the RIGHTS facet has 60+ individual values. Some of them are language or version variations of the same CC licence. Most users don’t want to select from that range of options. But we can categorize these rights statements under 3 main categories: In Europeana we use Apache Solr for searching. Our data model is called EDM (Europeana Data Model), which has almost 200 fields. We also have special fields for facets and we have some aggregated fields. What we wanted to achieve was to form a new facet from these options, but the most straightforward solution, i.e. to create a new field in Solr, was not an easily implementable option because it would require a full reindexing (it would be another blog entry to explain why that was not possible), so we had to search for another solution. To count the numbers belonging to the individual rights statements in the RIGHTS facet would work, but that’s only good for displaying, and it doesn’t cover the problem of user interaction. To use the RIGHTS field for search turned out to be risky because it interferes with the RIGHTS facet, so that did not worked either. Finally we come up with a fake facet, which has two sides: one on the display side, and one on the search side. To count the numbers we use a special Solr facet type: query facet. It is a simple, but at the same time a powerful solution. It doesn’t give you a list of existing field values, as a normal facet. In the query facet the input is a query, and the returning value is a single number, which tells you how many records fit the combination of the main query and the query specified in the facet’s parameter. Since we don’t need to know the list of items in the categories, that’s enough for us. We defined three queries: On the Europeana portal we use a fake facet called ”REUSABILITY”, and we use it in our filtering parameter (&qf) as REUSABILITY:open, or REUSABILITY:restricted or REUSABILITY:permission. These are shortcuts for the lengthy queries. We keep the interface (and the URL) clean. Explore this on the Portal: europeana.eu In the API we introduced the ”reusability” parameter with the same options as in the portal: “open”, “restricted” and “permission”. Example API call: http://europeana.eu/api/v2/search.json?wskey=%5BYOUR%20API%20KEY%5D&query=%3A&reusability=open Explore this in the API console: labs.europeana.eu/api/console/ For details of how this is implemented, including the actual Solr queries, read my original blog post at http://kirunews.blog.hu/2014/02/13/solr_query_facets_in_europeana For more information about the Europeana Data Model see http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation To find out more about the Europeana API check the extensive online documentation section at http://labs.europeana.eu/api/ Péter Király, April 2014http://nl.linkedin.com/in/peterkiraly/","tags":["Re-use","Rights","Facets","Technology"],"imageurl":"/img/blog/2014-04-25-Can-I-use-it.png","excerpt":"<p>Uncovering the technology behind the simple search tool to discover reusable content available in both the Europeana  portal and API.</p>\n\n"},{"title":"Coding Da Vinci","url":"/events/Coding_DaVinci","date":"2014-04-26 00:00:00 +0200","categories":["events"],"body":"The hackathon is organised by the German Digital Library, Digital Service Center Berlin, Open Knowledge Foundation Germany and Wikimedia Germany.

The users can start their search by entering a keyword in the search field (in any language!) or by selecting one of the ‘badges’ on the search page which represent entry points to the four themes. To narrow further the search, they use the in-theme filters in the left-hand menu.

Users tap a thumbnail to view the image in full resolution and can find out more about it by reading image’s card or connecting to other relevant web pages for more context. They can also comment on the image and read other users’ impressions; add the image to their favourites; share it on Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest; or create their own personal virtual museum on their topic of interest.

For those not able to attend, the event will be livestreamed at http://xmpp.iglor.es/appscultura_europeanalab/ This post is also a place where anyone interested in the challenges can post ideas and requests related to the API and the Challenge - just add a comment below and we’ll respond. You should find everything you need to get started using the Europeana API in the Europeana Labs website. If you have any questions, just leave a comment below or check out the other ways to contact us. All metadata in Europeana is licensed as CC0 so is free to re-use. Individual items each have their own clearly marked license. the simplest way to find openly re-usable content is to use the parameter &reusability=open more information about the different licenses and how to query them is contained in the blog post Can I use it? This is a very common question from developers, so here’s a quick overview and a few details about what can and what can’t (currently at least) be done. every item returned in a standard search call will have a url to a thumbnail e.g. “edmPreview”: [ “http://europeanastatic.eu/api/image?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fcoleccionfff.unav.es%2Fbvunav%2Fi18n%2Fcatalogo_imagenes%2Fimagen_id.cmd%3FidImagen%3D10000592&size=LARGE&type=IMAGE” ] (note that if we have not been able to create a thumbnail, for example if the item is not an image, then a placeholder thumbnail will be returned) in addition, each item may have a direct link to the original media file. This is returned in the edmIsShowBy attribute (currently only available through an individual record call so you would need to iterate through each item in the search results - we currently have a new ‘rich’ profile in development that will return this attribute within the search results) you can query just for records that have such links by using &query=provider_aggregation_edm_isShownBy:* in your API call because of variability in the types of items and in the data supplied by providers, the format of these original files will vary (for example various image formats, pdfs, audio & video files, and links to html pages with image viewers). If you wanted to use this attribute for example to display high resolution images your code should first detect and check the format. A lot of work is being undertaken to address this and provide a more direct and precise way of retrieving original media, but as illustrated by sites like Culture Collage and museums.eu, and the Europeana Open Culture mobile app, rich experiences can still be created using the thumbnails alone. Our data, API and associated documentation are constantly updated and improved. Much of this is in response to feedback and requests received from our user community. However big or small, we would love to hear of your plans and answer any questions you may have.  Leave a comment below, or see some of the other ways to contact us.

By using the Europeana API we want to encourage people to re-use Europe’s digitised cultural heritage in innovative and creative ways! We’re currently looking for innovative applications that re-use Europeana content on the themes of Tourism & Social Networks. The team from Europeana will be organising a hands on workshop demonstrating how to use the Europeana API and include it in your applications. If you have an idea for a great application but are a little overwhelmed by what Europeana content you could use, how to access it, or maybe the usage restrictions then this is the workshop for you! Wednesday 16 July 2014 - Welcome & Introduction (17.00 - 17.20) - Showcasing Europeana content (17.20 - 17.30) - Barcelona specific datasets (17.30 – 18.00) - Europeana Api (18.00 – 18.20) - Questions & Answers (18.20 - 18.45) - Networking (18.45-20.00) Before the workshop, why not explore Europeana Labs so you can familiarise yourself with what is currently available and come prepared with questions relating to the Europeana API & specific data sets you’re looking for.  If you have any questions relating to the second round of challenges on Tourism & Social Networks this will be a great opportunity for you to ask and receive feedback/support! The event will also be web streamed and recorded so if you can’t make it to Barcelona on the day you’ll be able to watch online or catch up after the event.

Image credit: Madonna and Child, Ambrogio Borgognone (1465-1525) vanGo’d by Nina via the Europeana Creative pilot project VanGoYourself.  Are you a creative developer or entrepreneur? Would you like to use your skills to build an exciting product using Europe’s cultural heritage?  If so, take your idea, build a prototype that taps into the 33 million objects in the Europeana collections, then enter our latest challenges. Get started by visiting Europeana Labs, explore the pre-selected datasets for inspiration, and take a look at our pilot apps which demonstrate the kinds of things it’s possible to do with Europeana content and a bit of imagination. Once you develop your idea just register and submit your application on istart.org. Entries close 28 August 2014. The challenge finalists will be invited to pitch their idea to an investor audience at the Innovation Challenges Event in Barcelona on 23 September 2014, organised in collaboration with Apps&Culture. The best ideas (one for each theme of Tourism and Social Networks) will be awarded a hands-on Incubation Support Package prize. Over the course of three months, established experts in digital technologies, copyright, business development and marketing will help you bring your idea to market. Find out more about the challenges Europeana Labs is our new playground for developers. It’s a place for inspiration, innovation and sharing. Designed for our developer community, and driven by the feedback we received from you, we launched the Beta version back in April 2014 and have worked hard since then to refine the site to address the needs of our diverse and ever growing userbase. In one place, you’ll now find everything from practical support through to inspirational apps and content: We will now be concentrating on adding regular blog posts, events and yet more openly licensed datasets and inspirational apps. If there’s anything you’d like to see, just let us know. It is no surprise that amongst Europeana’s 33 million objects, provided by over 2,300 institutions across Europe, there is a great deal of rich and often unique World War One related material. As with all Europeana content, this is directly accessible through the Europeana API. There’s no better illustration of this than the Europeana 1914-18 website which is directly powered by the API. It delivers over 350,000 searchable records, including images, text, audio and video.   A unique aspect of these records is that they contain more than 130,000 items submitted by members of the public in the form of 10,000 personal stories, including photographs, diaries and war-related memorabilia. With most available under an open CC BY-SA license, there are some wonderful opportunities for creative re-use through the API.  Here are some example queries to get you started - browse the content through the Europeana Portal, or take a look at how you can retrieve these records for your own app through the API console: Our development team is constantly working to enhance the features available to access our content. This is through the APIs, other platforms such as the search portal, and specialist sites like Europeana 1914-18. You can always see the latest Rest API enhancements in our change log - in the last 12 months there have been many notable additions, for example a simplified rights-related search based on the question Can I use it? There’s a lot more in the pipeline and much of this is driven by requests from you, our users. We welcome feedback and suggestions, however big or small. This developer newsletter is sent out every few months, but if you want more immediate news sign up to our developer forum where you will see announcements of new features and have a chance to chat with fellow developers. Also, keep an eye on the Europeana Labs website which will be continuously updated with new datasets, apps, events and blog posts. There’s a handy rss feed too. If you’re working with the Europeana APIs and have something to share, do let us know. We’re always excited to read of new ways that developers have found to use our content and we feature the best of these here on Europeana Labs. For selected ones we’ll be inviting guest blog posts where you can share your experiences and promote your work.

Given the multilingual nature of the Europeana content, it’s always been an ambition to provide tools that ensure that a simple search will retrieve objects from collections with metadata in different languages. translateQuery.json is a wrapper that uses the Wikipedia API to return suggested translations in user-defined langauges and constructs the query syntax to then use in a standard search. A sample API call would be  which returns a json response that includes Users would then place that query string into a standard search.json call, which in this case adds over 500 records to the results compared to a simple search for just ‘butterfly’. Languages should be defined using the two-letter codes according to the ISO 639-1 standard. All we ask is that you don’t run search queries with more than about 6 ‘OR’ options as that puts quite a strain on our server!

The project is currently gathering relevant data related to  the First World War to feed the knowledge base it is currently developing. These data are re-used in a set of domain ontologies and named-entity recognition tools developed to assist the research of historians. The Europeana API offers a large dataset related to First World War, gathering  resources from national collections and film archives, and also exceptional primary resources collected from the public. Collections relevant to the First World War were selected by CENDARI. The list contains a total of 289,453 records from 49 collections, out of the 33 million records available in Europeana. In order to connect the CENDARI repository with the Europeana API, and to provide a mechanism to bring relevant content from Europeana into CENDARI, a script has been created which fetches records via the Europeana API, performs additional processing, and sends processed content to the CENDARI repository.  The import process involves several phases. The first phase consists is collecting unique identifiers of the records from the selected collection. Since a collection may consist not only of records related to the First World War, but can mix different subjects, it is necessary to apply an additional filter in order to get only relevant records. The filter which should be added to the search query is “world war I” OR “1914-1918”.  For instance: To filter data relevant for WW1 out of 170,596 records in collection 08547_Ag_EU_ATHENA_Zuse-Institute_Berlin, the following search query is used http://europeana.eu/api/v2/search.json?wskey=xxxxxx&query=europeana_collectionName:08547_Ag_EU_ATHENA_Zuse-Institute_Berlin&qf=%22world+war+I%22+OR+%221914-1918%22 The second phase consists of retrieving data for the records gathered in the first stage. Each record can be fetched via the API in two formats, JSON and RDF (in accordance with the Europeana Data Model (EDM)  http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation). Three resources are created in the CENDARI repository for each Europeana record. They correspond to the JSON representation of a record, a record in RDF format, and the original digital object. While the first two are downloaded and stored in the CENDARI repository, the third is only linked to the object at the original location given by the data provider, and not stored or cached locally, so that potential copyright issues are avoided. Original grouping of records which exist in Europeana are preserved to provide CENDARI users with an easy way to browse within a selected Europeana collection. In order to improve the quality of search on imported data, for each record the following information is extracted, if present: data provider, Europeana identifier, dc:source, dc:type, dc:subject, and dc:creator. At the moment of writing, CENDARI has imported 22,600 EDM records. The data will be re-used within the CENDARI environment to feed the knowledge base currently developed by the project. These data will be made available to historians through various means (named-entity recognition tool, ontologies) in order for them to directly re-use these data in their research.  The overall impression is that the Europeana API is well documented and easy to use. Thanks to the Europeana API tech team, there is a responsive forum for sharing ideas and suggestions, solving issues and answering questions related to the API. Note that there is a standard request limit 10,000 per day but it can be significantly increased for a single API key in specific cases (see https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/europeanaapi/FLh81ZbpLC0). It can also be worth noting and of interest for other API users that, although it is not currently specified in the documentation, we were able to get not only the JSON representation of the records, but also the original RDF (e.g. http://europeana.eu/api/v2/record/9200196/BibliographicResource_3000005913596_source.rdf?wskey=xxxxxx)","tags":["API","research"],"imageurl":"/img/blog/CENDARI-and-the-Europeana-API.jpg","excerpt":"<p><em>By Valentine Charles (EuropeanaFoundation) and Milica Knezevic (Mathematical Institute SANU)</em></p>\n\n"},{"title":"Redesign your cultural heritage at Mozilla Festival 2014","url":"/events/mozilla-festival-2014","date":"2014-10-25 00:00:00 +0200","categories":["events"],"body":"Redesign Your Cultural Heritage! is taking place at the Mozilla Festival as a part of the Art & Culture on the Web track. Facilitators: Sanna Marttila, Neea Laakso, Kati Hyyppä (Aalto University), Christina Holm (Spild af Tid ApS), James Morley (Europeana) The aim of the Redesign Your Cultural Heritage! session is to connect the digital cultural heritage offered by Europeana to communities of designers and artists who wish to use open cultural content - data, pictures, sound, videos -  as inspiration and sources for new derivative works, such as animations and films, media art and installations, textile patterns, and other design artefacts.  In this hands-on session the facilitators guide you through making of open cultural works on specific themes and introduce participants to digital and open cultural heritage online. Participants can also work on their own and build upon the materials and digital cultural heritage content gathered and provided by the session. The aim is to facilitate creative reuse of cultural heritage content in multiple levels and accommodate various skills of participants - both more experienced and beginner open culture hackers.

Please also check the license of the content, making sure that re-use for your project context is allowed. To make things easier, discoverherereusable content available in both the Europeana portal and API. To give you some more concrete idea of works that could be made using the Europeana content, below are some examples. These are meant as examples only, so let your inspiration run free and propose new innovative ideas: In order to help inspire you Europeana Creative has developed a pilot application to demonstrate the things you can do with Europeana content and a little bit of imagination. Culture Cam has been developed by partnersSpild af Tid&AIT - Austrian Institute of Technologyas the design theme pilot; a “live” digital similarity tool that takes you on a playful journey into the fascinating collections within Europeana by using your web camera. You can easily scan an object, and Culture Cam captures and analyzes it and comes up with search results of similar color, shape or pattern. This pilot is still in its demo phase so please watch this space for more information.

Softwares will range from storytelling tools that enable reuse to OCRs or libraries and everything inbetween. Enjoy!  Joe Germuska is (Chief Nerd) Director of Software Engineering at Northwestern University’s KnightLab. KnightLab specialises in technologies that take journalism and digital storytelling to a new level. The majority of its tools are open source and TimelineJS, a user-friendly timeline software that has been used by numerous media outlets including RadioLab, TIME Magazine,  and Le Monde. Before starting at Northwestern, Joe was on the Chicago Tribune News Apps team, co-founded OpenGovChicago, hosts a weekly radio show on WNUR-FM – Conference of the Birds.  I’ve been working with Zach Wise on a new version of TimelineJS. The old version of TimelineJS loaded a full copy of jQuery, which was kind of heavyweight, and sometimes lead to version collision problems when people embedded a Timeline in their own webpage. For the new version (and for StoryMapJS which we developed last year), we instead copied a small portion of code from the Zepto library, just to handle all of the cross-browser, cross-server complexity of AJAX. We always prefer open source tools, so the laundry list is long, and in some ways maybe not surprising: we use python for all of our server side code, including Django or Flask for web applications as appropriate. We also use the Fabric python library for build and deployment management, including with our javascript tools. We use lots of python libraries like requests, tweepy, Beautiful Soup, and on and on. We use Ubuntu for our servers, and on them we run Apache HTTPD, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and ElasticSearch. We use common node tools like LESS and uglifyjs for the javascript libraries. We don’t want people who want to use our software to have to buy other stuff to use it. We are hoping that the new version of TimelineJS is slightly better factored to support community code contributions, although it’s also just hard to clearly communicate design intentions and priorities to a wider community. I know it’s frustrating when people develop a useful enhancement to an open source project which doesn’t get accepted by the core developers, but we’ve also found that a lot of people want to make TimelineJS do things that bend it away from our considered design choices. In a pretty different vein, we’ve been working on a toolkit for monitoring URL sharing on twitter, inspired by Nieman Lab’s Fuego. Over the summer, we worked with one of their developers to create a new engine that does collection and indexing. People will still need some development skills to use that to publish a website. We’ll have a more formal announcement pretty soon, and we are looking forward to seeing what people build with it. I’m not particularly looking for any tool or library. Rather, I’m interested in helping people become more fluent with information technology. It’s going to be cool when we can “read” computers like we read books, with almost no friction. Anything we can do to reduce that friction is interesting. I’m inspired by people like Bret Victor, who push us to imagine media for thinking the unthinkable, but I think there are a lot of incremental steps to get there. I’ll be happy if I can keep being part of thinking about that problem and making small steps forward.

Software will range from storytelling tools that enable reuse to OCRs or libraries and everything in between. Enjoy!  Professor Eero Hyvönen directs the Semantic Computing Research Group SeCo at Aalto Universiy, Finland. Since 2002, a major goal and research theme in SeCo has been creating a national Semantic Web infrastructure in Finland based on ontologies and ontology and data services. In this work, Cultural Heritage Linked Data has been a major application domain and many applications of SeCo are now in use, such as MuseumFinland; (2004), CultureSampo; (2008), BookSampo; (2011) of Finnish Public Libraries, and ONKI  (2008) Finto; (2014) ontology service of the National Library of Finland. Using and creating Open Source tools and Linked Open Data has been a long tradition in SeCo. He has published over 300 research articles and books in addition to winning the Semantic Web Challence Award (twice) and several other awards. We are pleased to feature Mr. Eero Hyvönen in our latest addition of “Who’s Using What?” Our infrastructure is based on W3C Semantic Web ;standards and on thesauri, gazetteers, and data sources already in use in Finland. At the moment we use, e.g.,Jena Fuseki, and  Varnish  for the “7-star” Linked Data Finland data service and ONKI Light Skosmos for ontology services, Silk and Sieve for data aligning,Lucene for data indexing and searching, YASGUI for SPARQL querying, protégé for ontology editing, LODE and vocab.at for dataset documentation, and jQuery , AngularJS, D3.js, and Sgwizler for user interfaces and visualizations. There are also quite a few Open Source tools that we have used in larger applications before, such as Cocoon, Spring, and Tapestry  as web development frameworks, and SWI Prolog for logic programming. On the tooling side, the SeCo Lexical Analysis Service combines various open source language technology tools into a web service, and SPARQL SAHA makes use of them for automatic annotation and data curation. Aether is a tool for analyzing Linked Data dynamics,  csv2whatever is a tool for data transformations, and Snapper is a browser-based Turtle editor. For linked data and ontology creation, publishing, and reuse, the Linked Data Finland platform is being developed further and is combined with various tools for a comprehensive Linked Data publishing service. Application prototypes being developed at the moment include Semantic National Biography for enriching and linking over 6300 of short life stories on the Semantic Web, Semantic Finlex for publishing and using Finnish legislation as a Linked Data service, and WarSampo for publishing historical datasets as Linked Data related to WW1 and WW2. We collaborate with historians in Stanford University, University of Oxford, and Colorado University Boulder regarding representing and visualizing history as Linked Data. The Web of Data, based on RDF and complicated semantics, requires collaboration and mutual agreements and standards between data publishers and users. When one creates data, one should also think, how it will link with the other parties’ data around, otherwise problems will arise later. Problems, that could have been prevented by collaboration and using a shared Semantic Web infrastructure and services. Albert Einstein’s saying “Intellectuals solve problems, geniuses prevent them” has been a motto in our work, aiming creating a sustainable, cross-domain Semantic Web infrastructure and applications in Finland, compatible with international developments.

It puts a real-time, proximity driven system right into the hands of users, leveraging the potential of iBeacons technology with the Europeana’s extensive database. By placing a beacon near a specific point of interest, the app can determine the user position in a town square as well as in a museum room or large exhibit, always displaying the correct information about the work of art they’re facing. Users can discover new facts, engage in fun puzzles and quizzes to explore the surroundings, while museum curators or the local tourism bureau can have a deep insight about what people really visited.","tags":["API Implementation"],"imageurl":"/img/apps/europeana-beacon.png","excerpt":"<p>Europeana Beacon was the winner of the <a href=\"http://www.appsforeurope.eu/\">Apps for Europe</a> award at <a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/hack4pisa-registration-12152387117\">Hack4Pisa</a>, October 2014.</p>\n\n"},{"title":"TuoMuseo / YourMuseum","url":"/apps/TuoMuseo","date":"2014-12-07 00:00:00 +0100","categories":["apps"],"body":"TuoMuseo was one of the winning entries in the Hack4Pisa event in October 2014.

Here we highlight ways to access content, and outline techniques that you can use to discover more via Europeana’s API. The Europeana Portal provides an easy, visual way to manually source content for your app. Try things like cookbooks or recipes, drinking songs or cups and glasses. All these searches are based on openly licensed material, but if your use is non-commercial this opens up even more possibilities. To see some specific examples of what you might find, we’ve compiled a list of around 30 top openly licensed images You should find everything you need to get started using the Europeana API in the Europeana Labs website. Want to look for content from across Europe but don’t know the word for beer in Swedish, or for sausage in Italian? The Europeana translation API uses Wikipedia to provide translated terms in many European langauges, returning a search string that you can use directly in our standard search API method. You need to specify your term, and the list of languages that you want results for (up to a maximum of about 6 for performance reasons). Here’s an example:  http://europeana.eu/api/v2/translateQuery.json?languageCodes=en,de,fr,it,es,sv&wskey=api2demo&term=beer  whose response includes  \"translatedQuery\": \"beer OR \\\"Beer\\\" OR \\\"Öl\\\" OR \\\"Cerveza\\\" OR \\\"Birra\\\" OR \\\"Bier\\\" OR \\\"Bière\\\"\"  Putting this into a standard search gives over 47,000 results, compared with 29,500 if you search for beer alone.  http://europeana.eu/api/v2/search.json?wskey=api2demo&query=beer%20OR%20\\%22Beer\\%22%20OR%20\\%22%C3%96l\\%22%20OR%20\\%22Cerveza\\%22%20OR%20\\%22Birra\\%22%20OR%20\\%22Bier\\%22%20OR%20\\%22Bi%C3%A8re\\%22&start=1&rows=20&profile=rich  Find out more about the tranlsation API on our previous blog post http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/new-translation-method-in-API/ All metadata in Europeana is licensed as CC0 so is free to re-use. Individual items each have their own clearly marked license. the simplest way to find openly re-usable content is to use the parameter &reusability=open more information about the different licenses and how to query them is contained in the blog post Can I use it? This is a very common question from developers, so here’s a quick overview and a few details about what can and what can’t (currently at least) be done. every item returned in a standard search call will have a url to a thumbnail e.g. “edmPreview”: [ “http://europeanastatic.eu/api/image?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fcoleccionfff.unav.es%2Fbvunav%2Fi18n%2Fcatalogo_imagenes%2Fimagen_id.cmd%3FidImagen%3D10000592&size=LARGE&type=IMAGE” ] (note that if we have not been able to create a thumbnail, for example if the item is not an image, then a placeholder thumbnail will be returned) in addition, each item may have a direct link to the original media file. This is returned in the edmIsShowBy attribute, but note that you must set &profile=rich to have these returned in standard search results. you can query just for records that have such links by using &qf=provider_aggregation_edm_isShownBy:\\* in your API call because of variability in the types of items and in the data supplied by providers, the format of these original files will vary (for example various image formats, pdfs, audio & video files, and links to html pages with image viewers). If you wanted to use this attribute for example to display high resolution images your code should first detect and check the format. A lot of work is being undertaken to address this and provide a more direct and precise way of retrieving original media, but as illustrated by sites like Culture Collage and museums.eu, and the Europeana Open Culture mobile app, rich experiences can still be created using the thumbnails alone. If you have any questions, just leave a comment below or check out the other ways to contact us. Our data, API and associated documentation are constantly updated and improved. Much of this is in response to feedback and requests received from our user community. However big or small, we would love to hear of your plans and answer any questions you may have.
