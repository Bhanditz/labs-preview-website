<p><strong>Search Engine For Europeana</strong> - A search engine that links data together to enable improved search.</p><p>Semantic-searching – a research prototype created for Europeana by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam<a href='http://www.vu.nl'>VU.nl</a>) – uses linked data, which gives machines the ability to make associations and put search terms into context.</p><p>For example, a search for ‘Paris' intuitively leads to connected concepts such as items in the Louvre, a Paris-based institution, or paintings portraying people named Paris, such as the Greek prince who abducted Helen of Troy. From there, more links point the way to topics like the ‘myth of Paris' or the mythical Apple of Discord - a golden apple that sparked a dispute and eventually led to the Trojan War - and then on to the forbidden apple eaten by Adam and Eve.</p><p>The semantic-search engine contains data of the<a href='http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/'>Rijksmuseum Amsterdam</a>, the<a href='http://www.louvre.fr/'>Musée du Louvre</a> in Paris, and the <a href='http://website.rkd.nl/'>Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie</a> (Netherlands Institute for Art History) in The Hague.</p><p>As a work-in-progress, multilingual support for semantic-searching is limited. The prototype's interface is available in English, French and Dutch.</p><p>See the Semantic Searching prototype:<a href='http://eculture.cs.vu.nl/europeana/session/search'>Semantic Searching Prototype</a></p>
