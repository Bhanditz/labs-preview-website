<p><strong>Metadata mapping</strong> - The mapping and validation of metadata formats for audiovisual content, and visualisation of mappings.</p><p>This service addresses the problem of mapping metadata models, e.g. the metadata properties in a model, including partial mappings. A high-level intermediate representation is used together with mapping templates on data-type levels. The high-level intermediate representation is based on an existing ontology. Mapping instructions are derived from its description, thus are easier to maintain than hard-coded ones. The high-level representation serves as a hub for mapping between standards. Therefore, handcrafted 1:1 mappings between each pair of metadata standards are avoided, and created automatically instead. Adding a new metadata standard is done without side effects to existing standards, since a new metadata standard is only connected directly to the hub.</p><p>In addition, a visualisation of the derived mappings between source and target formats is also available. The set of metadata formats and properties are regularly added to.</p>
