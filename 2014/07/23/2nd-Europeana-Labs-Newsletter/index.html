<h2 id="europeana-labs-update">Europeana Labs Update</h2>

<p>Europeana Labs is our new playground for developers. It’s a place for inspiration, innovation and sharing. Designed for our developer community, and driven by the feedback we received from you, we launched the Beta version back in April 2014 and have worked hard since then to refine the site to address the needs of our diverse and ever growing userbase.</p>

<p>In one place, you’ll now find everything from practical support through to inspirational apps and content:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s the home for our <a href="http://labs.europeana.eu/api/">API documentation</a> and the <a href="http://labs.europeana.eu/api/console/">API console</a> where you can experiment with API calls. </li>
  <li>There are examples of <a href="http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/#tag=client-library">client libraries</a> and 50 selected <a href="http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/#tag=open-source-tools">open source tools</a> that will help developers quickly build new apps using the Europeana API and content.</li>
  <li>You’ll find <a href="http://labs.europeana.eu/data/">featured datasets</a>, selected to showcase providers who have supplied high quality, openly licensed, re-usable content. </li>
  <li>Our <a href="http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/">apps gallery</a> aims to inspire new ideas by featuring the wide range of existing applications.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will now be concentrating on adding regular blog posts, events and yet more openly licensed datasets and inspirational apps. If there’s anything you’d like to see, just <a href="http://labs.europeana.eu/support/contact/">let us know</a>.</p>

<h2 id="focus-on-world-war-one">Focus on World War One</h2>

<p>It is no surprise that amongst Europeana’s 33 million objects, provided by over 2,300 institutions across Europe, there is a great deal of rich and often unique World War One related material. As with all Europeana content, this is directly accessible through the Europeana API. There’s no better illustration of this than the <a href="http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/">Europeana 1914-18 website</a> which is directly powered by the API. It delivers over 350,000 searchable records, including images, text, audio and video.   A unique aspect of these records is that they contain more than 130,000 items submitted by members of the public in the form of 10,000 personal stories, including photographs, diaries and war-related memorabilia. With most available under an open CC BY-SA license, there are some wonderful opportunities for creative re-use through the API. </p>

<p>Here are some example queries to get you started - browse the content through the Europeana Portal, or take a look at how you can retrieve these records for your own app through the API console:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Over 10,000 user contributed stories: <a href="http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/collection/search?count=12&amp;page=1&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;qf%5Bindex%5D=c">Browse stories</a> | <a href="http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=*%3A*&amp;rows=24&amp;qf=%28%22world%2Bwar%2BI%22+OR+%221914-1918%22%29&amp;qf=UGC%3Atrue">Browse items</a> | <a href="http://labs.europeana.eu/api/console/?function=search&amp;query=*:*&amp;qf=(%22world+war+I%22)%20OR%20(%221914-1918%22)&amp;qf=UGC:true&amp;profile=minimal&amp;reusability=open">API console</a></li>
  <li>The Somme in WW1: <a href="http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=Somme&amp;rows=24&amp;qf=%28%22world%2Bwar%2BI%22+OR+%221914-1918%22%29">Browse items</a> | <a href="http://labs.europeana.eu/api/console/?function=search&amp;query=somme&amp;qf=(%22world+war+I%22%20OR%20%221914-1918%22)">API console</a></li>

<h2 id="api-news">API news</h2>

<p>Our development team is constantly working to enhance the features available to access our content. This is through the APIs, other platforms such as the search portal, and specialist sites like Europeana 1914-18. You can always see the latest Rest API enhancements in our <a href="http://labs.europeana.eu/api/changelog/">change log</a> - in the last 12 months there have been many notable additions, for example a simplified rights-related search based on the question <a href="http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/can-i-use-it/">Can I use it?</a> There’s a lot more in the pipeline and much of this is driven by requests from you, our users.</p>
