<p>Apps&amp;Cultura has teamed up with Europeana Creative for this year’s Hack at Home competition, an exciting new European project which enables and promotes greater re-use of cultural heritage resources by Europe’s creative industries.  By using the Europeana API we want to encourage people to re-use Europe’s digitised cultural heritage in innovative and creative ways! We’re currently looking for innovative applications that re-use Europeana content on the themes of Tourism &amp; Social Networks.</p>

<p>The team from Europeana will be organising a hands on workshop demonstrating how to use the Europeana API and include it in your applications. If you have an idea for a great application but are a little overwhelmed by what Europeana content you could use, how to access it, or maybe the usage restrictions then this is the workshop for you!</p>
